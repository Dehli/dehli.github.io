Sneeki was an anonymous, location based, photo and video sharing app. When you opened the app, you would see photos and videos that had been taken within 5 miles of your current location. You could vote on posts, comment on them, or even private message them to other users. It was a full featured app that I loved creating. I created a native iOS version and Android version. My intention with the app was to be a method for people to stay connected to others around them. Through Sneeki I learned Swift, Android development, as well as all the processes that go into creating, publishing, and maintaining a mobile app.

Sneeki was my first big app. I started working on it in July of 2014 and released the initial version in September.
