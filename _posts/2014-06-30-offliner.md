This past month has been quite a journey! I've moved from Virginia, to my own apartment in Pittsburgh to start a new job. I've been programming after work to release my own apps onto the AppStore. I've submitted three apps this month, and as of yesterday I finally had one approved and available for download. Through this journey, I've become more involved with the opensource community (GitHub), and more familiar with the iTunes app requirements. Hopefully my next app will be released on its first submission!

Offliner for Imgur&reg; is an iOS application written in Objective-C. It's my first app that's been released on the App Store. It downloads the top images and gifs from [Imgur.com](https://imgur.com) and allows users to view them without internet connection.

If you want to check it out, you can get it on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/offliner-for-imgur/id886642092)!
