title:  Flappy Bird & Smalltalk
---

Last week, in my OOPLS class, I was given the task to program a game in Smalltalk, using the Squeak environment and Morphic objects. I chose to recreate Flappy Bird. It's pretty fun to play on the computer. If I had more time, I would've liked to have added sound effects, better animations, and a background. If you'd like the source, or have any questions, feel free to contact me!
