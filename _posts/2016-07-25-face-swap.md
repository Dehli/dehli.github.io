## Step 1: Find the faces

First I used [`dlib.get_frontal_face_detector`](http://dlib.net/python/#dlib.get_frontal_face_detector)
to find all the faces in the image.

## Step 2: Find each face's landmarks

Next I used [`dlib.shape_predictor`](http://dlib.net/python/#dlib.shape_predictor)
to identify 68 important points in each of the faces from the previous step. This resulted
in features such as the nose, eyes, eyebrows, lips, and jaw line.

## Step 3: Turn the landmarks into a mesh

Once I had the landmarks, I used a technique called [Delauney triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation)
to create a series of triangles representing the mesh. I averaged the two meshes so that the triangles from each face
would be made up of the same landmark points. I found that there were two ways to generate the mesh that worked
with varying results. The first image is creating a mesh using all of the landmark points, and the second image
shows using just the outer landmarks.

## Step 4: Swap the triangles

Next, I used math to warp the source triangles to match their destination and I swapped each set of triangles.
You can see the difference between using all or just the outer landmarks here.

## Step 5: Blend

Then, I blended the faces so that the edges looked smoother. I created a mask by generating a convex
hull from the points ([`cv2.convexHull`](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d3/dc0/group__imgproc__shape.html#ga014b28e56cb8854c0de4a211cb2be656)).

And finally, I used [`cv2.seamlessClone`](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/photo/doc/cloning.html#seamlessclone)
to apply the masks and create these masterpieces.
