title:  The AppStore
---

This past month has been quite a journey! I've moved from home in Virginia, to my own apartment in Pittsburgh to start a new job, and I've been vigorously programming after work to release my own apps onto the AppStore. I've submitted three apps this month, and as of yesterday I finally had one approved and available for download. Through this journey, I've become more involved with the opensource community (GitHub), and more familiar with the iTunes app requirements. Hopefully my next app will be released on its first submission!

If you want to check out my first app, you can get it here:
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgur-offline/id886642092" title="iTunes Store" target="_blank">Imgur Offline</a>. It downloads the top images from Imgur.com so you can view them later without an internet connection. I thought of this while on an airplane, wishing I had internet. Feel free to give me feedback!
