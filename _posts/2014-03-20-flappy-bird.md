[Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) is an object-oriented language, dynamically typed programming language that first appeared in 1972. Everything in Smalltalk inherits from a base `ProtoObject`.

Transcript show: 'Hello, world!'.

In my Object Oriented class, our assignment was to create a game using Smalltalk. We used the [Squeak](http://squeak.org/) environment along with [Morphic](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/morphic). The environment was a little difficult to work
with, and the language seemed out of date, but overall it was a good learning experience.

For my game, I chose to recreate Flappy Bird. It's just as frustrating as the one for your phone (notice my low score). If I had more time, I would have liked to add sound effects, better animations, and a background. Get flapping!
