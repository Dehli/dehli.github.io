Luna Racing is a 3d game build using [Microsoft XNA Game Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA_Game_Studio). It was built specifically for the Xbox 360.

In Luna Racing, you're in outer space with a handful of other players (both real and aritificial). There's asteroids you must avoid, and power ups you can get that make the game more fun. The objective is to be the first player to fly around the map and collect the +1 box. The first player to collect 10 wins!

It has lots of really cool features including:
- Local multiplayer through split screen
- LAN multiplayer
- Online multiplayer using Xbox Live
- [Dead reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning)
- AI that learns over time how to better play the game
- Physics based engine

Watch a full game in the video!
