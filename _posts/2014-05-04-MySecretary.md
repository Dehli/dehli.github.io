Last Friday I presented my Capstone Project. I have worked on this project this whole school year, and to see the culmination of all my work was amazing. I, along with Nate Hagan and Michael Gerber, created MySecretary. An iOS application that could be the future of scheduling. When creating events, finding a time can be a pain. With MySecretary, you choose a length of time and an event category. MySecretary then goes to the cloud and finds a time that works for everyone, while conforming to the category selected.

First semester, we designed the application. We weren't allowed to do any programming until the second semester. Below are some screenshots from the app.
