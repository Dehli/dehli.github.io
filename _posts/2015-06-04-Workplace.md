I'm in the air, Minneapolis bound, and trying to think of what to do. I could read but I left my Kindle in the overhead compartment (seatbelts must stay on). I've been wanting to write about my dev environment so here it goes...

I have a 13" Macbook Air. I love it! It's fast enough for all the developing I do, has a great battery life, and it's sexy. I don't travel anywhere without it. I recently purchased a Kindle Paperwhite a take that along with me as well.

Depending on what I'm coding I have a variety of tools I go to. I'll split them up into the different groups.

iOS:
When coding for iOS devices I use XCode and code in Swift (with the occasional Objective-C). If you don't use CocoaPods start using it NOW! Swift + XCode have gotten a lot better since last summer.

Android:
I don't have a ton of Android experience but what I have done has been using Android Studio. I highly recommend downloading the GenyMotion simulator. I remember having difficulties with the default simulator but GenyMotion's ran smoothly.

Blogging:
I created my website using Jekyll (you can see my website's code here). When working on it , I have two environments I switch between. If I'm without internet (like I am now) I use Atom.io. It's Github's open-source, text-editor. \thumbsup If I have internet I use Koding.com.

Programming Puzzles:
I'm a big fan of HackerRank and recommend it to anyone who wants to sharpen their programming skills. I like solving those puzzles in C++ or Python.

Games:
When I get around to making a game I intend to use Unity. I have a lot of experience using XNA (C#) but Microsoft no longer supports it, so it's time to choose a new engine. I've made a tiny game with Unity and intend to delve deeper into it when I have more time.

Work:
At work, I do a lot of AngularJS, C++, and C#. I use Visual Studio for that (wish I could use my Mac).

Task Management:
To keep myself accountable with all of my independent projects, I use Slack, Trello, and a lot of Google Docs. This keeps me accountable and keeps my thoughts organized.

So that's it. If you have any questions, write them in the comments below! I'm excited to hear about your workplace. Time for me to go grab my Kindle!
