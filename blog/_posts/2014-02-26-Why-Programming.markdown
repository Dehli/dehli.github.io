title:  Why Programming?

Oftentimes, in interviews, I'm asked why I chose to be a computer programmer. It's an important question, so I decided to answer it here!

In 6th grade, on career day, a robotics engineer presented a Lego robot to give us a glimpse into what he did. The robot captivated me; I had to make one. After research, I found a competition called First Lego League. In this competition, you'd create and program a Lego robot that would navigate an obstacle course.

In 7th grade, I started a team, and learned my first programming language: RoboLab. After a year of RoboLab, I moved onto Mindstorms NXT. Both of these languages had drag and drop interfaces, however it gave me programming experience for four years.

After First Lego League, I continued to program. In 11th grade, I was exposed to a form of BASIC, called PBASIC, when I programmed a robot to autonomously parallel park. In 12th grade, I took a Java class where I created a program to register how long it would take somebody to recognize a word versus an image. I tested to see if there was a relationship between hand dominance and image or word recognition time.

All this exposure to programming helped me to realize that computer science was what I should study. The ability to synthesize my creativity and technical skills, while solving a problem, are what I love about the field!
