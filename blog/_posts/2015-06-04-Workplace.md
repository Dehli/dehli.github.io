I'm in the air, Minneapolis bound, and trying to think of what to do. I could read but I left my Kindle in the overhead compartment (seatbelts must stay on). I've been wanting to write about my dev environment so here it goes...

First, let's talk hardware. I have a 13" Macbook Air. I love it! It's fast enough for all the developing I do, has a great battery life, and it's sexy. I don't travel anywhere without it. I also bring my Kindle Paperwhite along with me. It's my favorite e-reader I've ever owned.

The flight attendants just came, I got a bloody mary mix and cookies (the usual).

Now let's talk coding. Depending on what I'm coding I have a variety of tools I go to. I'll split them up into the different groups.

iOS:
When coding for iOS devices I use XCode and code in Swift (with the occasional Objective-C). If you don't use CocoaPods start using it NOW! Swift + XCode have gotten a lot better since last summer.

Android:
I don't have a ton of Android experience but what I have done has been using Android Studio. I highly recommend downloading the GenyMotion simulator. I remember having difficulties with the default simulator but GenyMotion's ran smoothly.

Blogging:
I created my website using Jekyll (you can see my website's code here). When working on it , I have two environments I switch between. If I'm without internet (like I am now) I use Atom.io. It's Github's open-source, text-editor. \thumbsup

If I have internet I use Koding.com. You get a terminal and 3 gigs of space (free 500 megs for both of us if you sign up here). It's nice because I can view my code on my phone right away with minimal configuration. Check out the guide I wrote here for using Jekyll with Koding.

Programming Puzzles:
I'm a big fan of HackerRank and recommend it to anyone who wants to sharpen their programming skills. I like solving those puzzles in C++ or Python using Atom.io.

Games:
When I get around to making a game I intend to use Unity. I have a lot of experience using XNA (C#) but Microsoft no longer supports it, so it's time to choose a new engine. I've made a tiny game with Unity and intend to delve deeper into it when I have more time.

Work:
At work, I do a lot of AngularJS, C++, and C#. I use Visual Studio for that (definitely prefer deving on my Mac).

Task Management:
To keep myself accountable with all of my independent projects, I use Slack, Trello, and a lot of Google Docs. This keeps me accountable and keeps my thoughts organized.

So that's it. If you have any questions, write them in the comments below! Excited to hear about you workplace. Time for me to go grab my Kindle!
