This summer I will be involved with [Alpha Stars Program](http://alphastarsprogram.com) (I used Bootstrap and Jekyll to make the site).

The program will be made up of teams each working on a business idea. Each team will be made up of both business and technical individuals. Together they'll create a product that they will demonstrate at the end of the summer.

I'll be the tech mentor for the teams. [Sneeki](http://sneekiapp) gave me a lot of real world experience. Here are seven questions I wish I asked myself before release.

1. Is your product prepared for rapid growth?
2. Can your product be used for something other than intended?
3. How will you guide your app in the direction you want?
4. Negative feedback is much easier to get than positive. How are you going to encourage people to rate/review your product?
5. Do you have big changes planned for after the release date? If so, will your UI need to change to accomodate them?
6. How does your product set itself apart from other products?
7. Does your product market itself? How do you intend for people to find out about it?
