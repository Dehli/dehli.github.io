Sneeki is an anonymous, location based, photo and video sharing app. I created it as a method for people to stay connected to others around them.

Through Sneeki I learned Swift, Android development, as well as all the processes that go into creating, publishing, and maintaining a mobile app.

The map below shows all of the locations where Sneeki photos were taken. It's been a lot of fun seeing Sneeki spread!
